                <p>Traffic management on roads and highways is kind of a daring challenge now-a-days. 
                    Traffic rules are constituted by three level of government in Canada- federal, provincial and municipal. 
                    Federal involves cases related to criminal offences due to rash driving causing someone’s death or physically impairment. 
                    Province maintains highways traffics that pervades from them and municipal receives jurisdiction from provincial governments to regulate rules and regulations for safe driving in their area itself. 
                    But people in Canada are advised to follow more than just legal laws in order to reach their home safely. 
                    </p>

                <h2>How to get a driving license in Canada</h2>
                <p>If you want to drive in Canada, you will need Canadian Driving License that are issued by government of the province that you are living in or an International Driving Permit (IDP) from your home country. You must have your license with you all the time while driving in Canada. Canadian Driving Licences also work in many other countries like Italy, Albania, and Malta provided if they have legal agreement with Canadian government.
                    Licenses in Canada are called Graduating Driving License(GDL) which means we need to graduate from G1 to G2 and G.</p>
                    
                <h3>G1 license</h3>
                <p>To apply for a G1 license, you must be at least 16 years old and pass an eye and written test about the rules of the road and traffic signs. You need to answer 40 questions.
                    To ensure you ace the knowledge test to get your G1 the first time you try, you will want to study the Official Ministry of Transportation (MTO) Driver’s Handbook which is available online or you can buy a copy from local drive test Centre.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the day of your test, bring necessary documents that show your name, date of birth and signature. 
                        In addition to obeying the rules of the road like all other drivers, G1 drivers must:</p>
                <div class="blog-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drive with zero blood alcohol level</li>
                        <li>Must wear seat belts</li>
                        <li>Should not drive on highways</li>
                        <li>Not drive between the hours of midnight and 5:00 a.m.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>G2 license</h3>
                <p>To get your G2 license, you must pass a road test to gauge your basic driving skills. To do that you need to gain experience by practicing with a fully licensed driver. Once you are ready, book your test and take your driving test which is approximately 20 minutes, and you will be assessed based on the following:</p>
                <div class="blog-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Driving situations and rules of the road</li>
                        <li>Basic starting, stopping, turning, and passing.</li>
                        <li>Backing up, three-point turn, and parallel parking.</li>
                        <li>Driving through intersections that are controlled and uncontrolled.</li>
                        <li>Safe driving practices including driving the speed limit, steering techniques, and a roadside stop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>G license</h3>
                <p>Obtaining your full G-class license is the final stop in the Ontario graduated licensing program. While the road test to get your G2 assesses basic driving skills and does not consist of highway driving, 
                    the G test specifically tests expressway driving to ensure you can drive on the highway at high speeds. 
                    The bulk of the G test examines how you enter, merge into, drive along and exit expressways where the speed limit exceeds 80 km/hr.</p>
                <br>    
                    <p>The skill assessment is the same as that of G2, the only difference is in highway driving. <br>
                        These are the areas you need to practice before taking your G license driving test: </p>

                        <li>Turning and changing directions.</li>
                        <li>Traffic signs and lights.</li>

                        <li>Proper observation, foreseeing hazardous conditions, and blind spot checks.</li>
                        <li>Roadside stop and parallel parking.</li>
                        <li>Highway driving – entering, exiting, lane changes, maintaining proper speed.</li>
